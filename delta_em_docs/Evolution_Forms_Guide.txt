Form Change
=========================================================
Pokémon with manual form changes can change forms as described below.

Deoxys:
- Use the Meteorite (Key Item) that is obtained at Mt. Chimney after defeating Maxie.

Rotom:
- Talk to Lynette in front of the PC inside Fallarbor's Pokémon Center.
- Goto her house at Route 114 to receive the Rotom Catalog (Key Item).
- Then, use the Rotom Catalog on a Rotom.

Furfrou
- Talk to a woman in the Pokémon Fan Clun in Slateport.
- Each Furfrou (!default) form have a different secondary type.

Oricorio
- Use a Nectar item on it, as you would in official games.
- All Nectars spawn in Dewford and Verdanturf Meadow.
- There's a 33.33% of all of them spawning whenever the Player transition to the meadows.


Mega Evolution
===========================

- To mega evolve a Pokémon, you first need a Mega Ring. This is given to the Player by Steven after obtaining Latios
in the Souther Island event. Then, a Pokémon must hold a mega stone. When sent into battle, press START on the move
selection screen and then choose a move.
- Rayquaza works similarly, but must know Dragon Ascent INSTEAD of holding a mega stone. Dragon Ascent is a level-up move.
- Primal Reversion works similarly to mega evolution. It immediately triggers upon entering a battle.
