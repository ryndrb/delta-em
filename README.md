# Pokémon: Delta Emerald

Pokémon: Delta Emerald is an Emerald-based hack that incorporates ORAS's story. And will contain many other side-stories (TBD) as I play with it more.

## Features

This hack uses the `pokeemerald-expansion`. Most of its features are to be utilise.
I also added custom stuff myself, will list them here (or somewhere) if I remember them since I don't often work on this hack.

## Difficulty

- The planned difficulty of the hack is akin to the works of Drayano, but not quite the same.
- I MIGHT add difficulty options.
- A LOT of Pokémon stat distributions have been distributed "better". Only few have added points to their BST's.

## Credits

- RHH (pokeemerald-expansion)
- cyanSMP64 (HGSS/DPPt music)
- AsparagusEduardo (Decapitalization, Expanded Bag Pockets)
- BuffelSaft (Inclement Emerald)
- (Will add the sprites resource credits here once I remember them)
